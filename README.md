Homework based on Third party APIs
 
This assignment gave us some starter code to develop a working day planner using the DayJS library. The webpage displays the normal working hours, inwhich updates the color background accoring to the time of day it is. Red indicates the time field is currently within the hour, Green indicates it is yet to be that hour, and Gray indicates it is past the hour. There is a save button next to each field that will store whatever value is written into the planner of that hour into local storage, which will repopulate the planner's description field upon reloading.
